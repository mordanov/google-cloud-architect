### 1. Describe the current technical environment of EHR Healthcare and explain the role of Kubernetes clusters in their architecture.
Deeper Explanation:
EHR Healthcareâ€™s technical environment consists of software hosted in multiple colocation facilities. Their customer-facing applications are web-based and have recently been containerized, running on Kubernetes clusters. Data is stored in a mix of relational (MySQL, MS SQL Server) and NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) databases. Legacy file- and API-based integrations with insurance providers are still hosted on-premises, and user management is handled via Microsoft Active Directory. Monitoring is performed using various open-source tools, but alerting is inconsistent and often ignored.

The role of Kubernetes clusters is central to their modernization efforts. By containerizing applications and orchestrating them with Kubernetes, EHR Healthcare can achieve:

Consistent deployment and management of applications across environments.
Improved scalability and resource utilization.
Easier rollouts, rollbacks, and updates for applications.
The ability to dynamically provision new environments for onboarding new providers or scaling for demand.
Enhanced reliability and availability through self-healing and automated failover.
Kubernetes thus forms the backbone of their application deployment strategy, enabling EHR Healthcare to meet their goals for scalability, agility, and operational efficiency.
